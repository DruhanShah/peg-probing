#+title: Interpretability using PEGs
#+author: Druhan Shah, Abhinav S Menon and Manish Shrivastava

This is the repository containing all relevant code for the project "Parse Probing in PEGs".

* Running the code

For running this code on the =ada.iiit.ac.in= remote server, use =ada_wrapper.sh= as a python executable, since it manages the locations of data, models and auxiliary logs in the scratch and share directories on Ada.

#+begin_src bash
  python3 train_model.py # On local system
  ./ada_wrapper train_model.py # On Ada
#+end_src

For running on a local system, ensure the =device= and the =work_dir= parameters in the config file are set accordingly.

** Data generation

The main data for training is generated in =.pkl= files by running =generate_data.py= as mentioned above.

** Model training

The classifier model for the specific language is trained by running =train_model.py=. This will *not*
 work if the corresponding training data is missing!
