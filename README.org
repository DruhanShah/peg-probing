#+title: Interpretability using PEGs
#+author: Druhan Shah, Abhinav S Menon and Manish Shrivastava

This is the repository containing all relevant code for the project "Parse Probing in PEGs".

* Running the code

All experiments can be run through =main.py=. The behavior is controlled by the =config.yaml= file.

#+begin_src bash
python main.py
#+end_src

The task run by =main.py= will be determined by the =experiment.task= property in the config file. The possible values for this are:

- To train a model: :: =train_model=
- To train a probe: :: =train_probe=
- To run an intervention: :: =run_intervention=
