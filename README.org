* PEGs and DL Interpretability

This is the repository containing all relevant code for the project "Parse Probing in PEGs".

* Running the code

Running on a local system is a good deal tricky, and the =config.yaml= file hasn't been prepared for it yet.

For running this code on =ada.iiit.ac.in=, use =python_wrapper.sh= as a python executable, since it manages the locations of data, models and auxiliary logs in the scratch and share directories on Ada.

#+begin_src bash
  python3 train_model.py # On local system
  ./python_wrapper train_model.py # On Ada
#+end_src
